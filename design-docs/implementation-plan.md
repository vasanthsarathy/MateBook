# Test-Driven Agile Implementation Plan: Lichess Puzzle Extractor

## Testing Strategy Overview

Each sprint will follow a test-driven development (TDD) approach with these principles:

1. Write tests first, then implement functionality to pass those tests
2. Maintain a comprehensive test suite that grows with each feature
3. Use both unit and integration tests
4. Implement CI/CD to run tests automatically
5. Prioritize test coverage for critical components

## Sprint 1: Minimum Viable Product with Testing Foundation (2 weeks)

3. As a user, I want to see solutions on a separate page

### Testing Tasks:

1. Set up testing framework (pytest)
2. Create mock Lichess API responses for testing
3. Write unit tests for puzzle fetching logic

### Deliverable:

A robust application with thorough test coverage for error conditions and customization options.

## Sprint 4: Advanced Features with Component Testing (2 weeks)

**Goal:** Add advanced features with focused component testing.

### Test-First User Stories:

1. As a user, I want the application to compile LaTeX to PDF automatically
2. As a user, I want to ensure puzzles are unique and of high quality

## Sprint 5: Polish and Test Suite Refinement (2 weeks)

**Goal:** Polish the application and refine the test suite.

### Test-First User Stories:

1. As a user, I want an attractive, professional-looking PDF output
2. As a user, I want to optionally include or exclude puzzle ratings
3. As a user, I want to save and reuse puzzle sets

### Testing Tasks:

1. Develop visual regression tests for PDF output
2. Write tests for configuration persistence
